					<p>My trip to Portugal was a relatively short one tacked on to a larger itinerary that included a night in London and a weekend in Glasgow for a friend&#39;s wedding at Loch Lomond. It was a bit of a whirlwind. My friend and I had about a day and a half in Lisbon to wander around the city and we did one major touristy thing, climb the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel%C3%A9m_Tower" target="_blank">Belem Tower</a>. The fort itself is beautiful and there is a nice view of the Tagus River from the top. The tram ride over wasn&#39;t bad either and it gave us an opportunity to check out the colorful tiled facades typical of the buildings in Lisbon. </p>

				<h4 class="heading">Food and Booze</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>The best thing we did in Lisbon was dinner at a fado restaurant. I knew nothing about fado before traveling to Portugal, so I&#39;m so glad that my friend insisted on it. Fado is very dramatic, typically melancholy music that originated in Portugal and is usually performed by a female singer accompanied by a guitarist. Ana Moura is one of the recent popular artists, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A1lia_Rodrigues" target="_blank">Am√°lia Rodrigues</a> is probably the most well known. We chose <a href="http://www.srvinho.com/eng" target="_blank">Sr Vinho</a> for dinner and the music was wonderful. I enjoyed the food as well, but we were really there for the music.</p>

				<h4 class="heading">The Nitty Gritty</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>We stayed at a great hostel in Lisbon called <a href="http://www.royal-guesthouse.com/en" target="_blank" target="_blank">Pens&atilde;o Royal</a>. Paula, the woman who runs the hostel, was a total sweetheart who cooked all kinds of beautiful cakes and pastries every morning for breakfast. My friend and I shared a private ensuite room and the decor in our room, and throughout the hostel, was really fun and colorful. I highly recommend staying there, especially if Paula is still presiding.</p>
