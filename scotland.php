					<p>I&#39;ve been to Scotland a few times and this last trip was a quick one to Loch Lomond, near Glasgow, for a wedding. Scottish weddings weren&#39;t something on my radar before this trip, but now I know better than to pass up an opportunity to party with the Scots. There were tons of good food and booze, a band playing traditional Scottish music and a little something called Ceilidh dancing. It felt a lot wilder in person, but here is a <a href="http://vimeo.com/22797492" target="_blank">taste</a>.</p>

					<p>The wedding and reception were held in a beautiful old baronial manor house turned youth hostel, where everyone was booked in for the weekend. The hostel has since closed, which is a shame because it was a fantastic place to host a party.</p>

					<p>After the wedding we spent just one night in Glasgow before heading back to the States. We stayed in a trendy-looking little hotel in the city center called <a href="http://www.brunswickhotel.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Brunswick</a>.</p>

					<p>The best surprise for me though was the tasty food at <a href="http://www.dakhin.com/index.html" target="_blank">Dakhin</a>, a South Indian restaurant right around the corner from the hotel. I absolutely stuffed myself on dosas. It was a great ending to a fantastic week and a half of traveling and festivities.</p>
