					<p>I&#39;ve been to Scotland a few times and this last trip was a quick one to Loch Lomond, near Glasgow, for a wedding. Scottish weddings weren&#39;t something on my radar before this trip, but I know better now than to pass up an opportunity to party with the Scots. Aside from the fact that the bride and groom were two of the loveliest people I&#39;ve ever met, with the nicest friends and family, there were tons of good food and booze, a band playing traditional Scottish music, and a little something called Ceilidh dancing. It&#39;s a lot wilder in person, but here is a little <a href="http://vimeo.com/22797492" target="_blank">taste</a>.</p>

					<p>I definitely lost a shoe during one dance and had my feet trod on, but it was totally worth it. The wedding and reception were held in a beautiful old baronial manor house (read castle) turned youth hostel, where everyone was booked in for the weekend. The Loch Lomond Youth Hostel has since closed, which is a shame because it is a beautiful house in a lovely part of the country.</p>
					<p>After the wedding we spent just one night in Glasgow before heading back to the states, in a trendy little hostel in the city center called <a href="http://www.brunswickhotel.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Brunswick</a>. Our room was modern looking but cosy and the cafe downstairs opened up bright and early so we could get a bite to eat before heading to the airport.</p>
					<p>The best surprise during our time in Glasgow though was the incredibly tasty food at <a href="http://www.dakhin.com/index.html" target="_blank">Dakhin</a>, a South Indian restaurant right around the corner. I could have eaten those dosas till the cows came home. It was a nice ending to a fantastic week and a half of traveling and festivities.</p>
