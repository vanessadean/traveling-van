					<h4 class="heading">The Sights</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>I loved Sydney. It has beautiful city parks and public spaces, lots of neighborhoods to explore and fantastic beaches. We visited Bondi and Manly beaches while we were in town, and although the weather didn&#39;t cooperate with us for sunbathing at Bondi, the beach itself is gorgeous. It was also great weather for a little hike along the paved path up the coastline to Bronte.</p> 
					
					<p>The weather was better for our trip to Manly, which is about a 30 minute ferry ride across the harbor, and I managed to get a quick dip into the ocean before the jellyfish warnings went into full effect. You&#39;re never far from something that can maim or kill you in Australia. The town of Manly itself also has cute shops and restaurants, and we spent a full afternoon walking around. We ended up at a little restaurant called <a href="http://www.chicabonita.com.au/" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a> for lunch and had really tasty burritos and margaritas. It never ceases to amaze me how far away the love of Mexican food travels from its roots.<p>  

					<p>The absolute highlight of our trip to Sydney though was the <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/" target="_blank">Sydney Harbor Bridge Climb</a>. If you do it, splurge for the twilight tour over the top, or the dawn tour if you&#39;re a maniac. The view of the harbor from the top of the bridge is amazing, especially as the sun sets and the lights of the city turn on. Fair warning, if you are afraid of heights think very hard before taking the tour. You are strapped onto the bridge the whole time and it&#39;s perfectly safe, but there is no turning back once you get out there. There is also at least one point of the tour where you can see straight down to the water below.</p>

					<h4 class="heading">Food and Booze</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>Our dining and drinking highlights in Sydney included <a href="http://www.chatthai.com.au/" target="_blank">Chat Thai</a>, <a href="http://thewinerysurryhills.com.au/" target="_blank">The Winery</a>, <a href="http://yullis.com.au/" target="_blank">Yulli&#39;s</a> (vegan) and <a href="http://www.chicabonita.com.au/" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a> at Manly Beach.</p>
					<p>One other note: Dining out is crazy expensive in Australia, so be prepared for that. The cheap eats list on <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com" target="_blank">Urbanspoon</a> was really helpful on that front.</p>

					<p><b>Accommodations</b></p>
					<p>We flew to and from the states through Sydney, with visits to other parts of Australia in between, so our time there was split between two different hostels, the Y Hotel Hyde Park and Sydney Harbour YHA.</p>

					<p>Although the <a href="http://www.yhotel.com.au/content/hydepark.htm" target="_blank">Y Hotel Hyde Park</a> was not glamorous, it was clean, quiet and in a perfect location close to Hyde Park, a subway station and the bus to Bondi Beach. They also upgraded us to a private ensuite. Similar results not guaranteed, but I still highly recommend it.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/sydney-harbour/" target="_blank">Sydney Harbour YHA</a> was interesting. It&#39;s a brand new building in a fun, albeit touristy, neighborhood (The Rocks) and high on a hill overlooking Sydney Harbor and the Opera House. The view from the rooftop deck sold me on the place, and we did have a lovely little dinner of wine and cheese up there one night. BUT they couldn&#39;t book the three of us in the same room (they said we needed to make a special request, even though all three spots were booked at the same time and under the same credit card), and my travelmates had horrific problems with the A/C in their room (availability of A/C being one of the reasons we booked there). So although it was nice to be in a brand new building with amenities like power outlets next to every bunk, it was a bit soulless for my taste. Book with caution.</p>

					<p><b>Getting to and from the airport:</b></p> 
					<p>If you are staying somewhere in the center of Sydney (and near a train station) the <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/"target="_blank">Airport Link</a> train service is a breeze. It runs frequently, takes 30 minutes tops to get from the airport to your destination and is around $15 AUD one way. We took it to our hostel after nearly 24 hours of air travel from the states and I didn&#39;t regret it. However, on our second trip into Sydney we decided to splurge on a taxi and ended up sitting in rush hour traffic. Nothing makes me more crazy than sitting in a car that isn&#39;t moving, and I&#39;m pretty sure my travel mates wanted to kill me as I stared out the window, huffing and puffing. Take the train if you can. It&#39;s the least you can do after all that carbon you&#39;ve released into the atmosphere by flying there.</p>

					<p>Also, be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle bus (route 555) to get around the city center during the day. You can find more info on public transportation (and pretty much everything) here: <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/explore/getting-around/public-transport" target="_blank">City of Sydney</a></p>
