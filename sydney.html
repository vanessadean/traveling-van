					<div class="text_one">
					<p>Sydney is an incredible city. It&#39;s big enough to be a real metropolis, with lots of different neighborhoods to explore, and has tons of beautiful city parks and public spaces. But for me the icing on the cake is that it&#39;s just a half hour&#39;s bus or ferry ride to some amazing beaches. We managed to hit up two of them while we were in town, Bondi and Manly. Although the weather didn&#39;t quite cooperate with us for sunbathing at Bondi, the beach itself is gorgeous and there is a great little hike along a paved path up the coastline to Bronte.</p> 
					<br>
					<p>The weather was better for our trip to Manly, which is about a 30 minute ferry ride across the harbor, and I managed to get a quick dip into the ocean before the jellyfish warnings went into full effect. You&#39;re never far from something that can maim or kill you in Australia. The town of Manly itself is full of cute shops and restaurants, and we spent a full afternoon walking around. We ended up at a great little restaurant called <a href="http://www.chicabonita.com.au/" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a> for lunch and had really tasty burritos and margaritas. It never ceases to amaze me how far the love of Mexican food travels away from its roots.<p>  
					<br>
					<p>The absolute highlight of our trip to Sydney though was the <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/" target="_blank">Sydney Harbor Bridge Climb</a>. If you do it, splurge for the twilight tour or the dawn tour (if you&#39;re a maniac) over the top. There is an amazing view of the harbor from the top of the bridge and it just wouldn&#39;t have been as nice without watching the sun set and the lights of the city turn on. Fair warning, if you are afraid of heights think very hard before taking the tour. You are strapped onto the bridge the whole time and it&#39;s perfectly safe, but there is no turning back once you get out on the bridge and during at least one point of the tour you can see straight down to the water below.</p>

				<h4 class="two">Food and Booze</h4>
					<div class="text_two">
					<p>Our dining and drinking highlights in Sydney included <a href="http://www.chatthai.com.au/" target="_blank">Chat Thai</a>, <a href="http://thewinerysurryhills.com.au/" target="_blank">The Winery</a>, <a href="http://yullis.com.au/" target="_blank">Yulli&#39;s</a> (vegan) and <a href="http://www.chicabonita.com.au/" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a> at Manly Beach.</p>
					<br>
					<p>A couple of other notes: Dining out is crazy expensive in Australia, so be prepared for that. Luckily, and surprisingly, the cheap eats list on <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com" target="_blank">Urbanspoon</a> was incredibly helpful. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but that list is worth checking out.</p>

					<p><b>Accommodations</b></p>
					<p>We flew to and from the states through Sydney with visits to other parts of Australia in between, so we ended up splitting our time between two different hostels, the Y Hotel Hyde Park and Sydney Harbour YHA.</p> 
					<br>
					<p>Although the <a href="http://www.yhotel.com.au/content/hydepark.htm" target="_blank">Y Hotel Hyde Park</a> was not glamorous, it was clean, quiet and in a perfect location close to beautiful Hyde Park, a subway station and the bus to Bondi Beach. They also upgraded us to a private ensuite! Similar results not guaranteed, but I still highly recommend it.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The <a href="http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/sydney-harbour/" target="_blank">Sydney Harbour YHA</a> was interesting. It&#39;s a brand new building in a fun, albeit touristy, neighborhood (The Rocks) and high on a hill overlooking Sydney Harbor and the Opera House. The view from the rooftop deck sold me on the place, and we did have a lovely little dinner of wine and cheese up there one night. BUT they couldn&#39;t book the three of us in the same room (they said we needed to make a special request, even though all three spots were booked at the same time and under the same credit card), and my travelmates had horrific problems with the A/C in their room (availability of A/C being one of the reasons we booked there). So although it was nice to be in a brand new building with amenities like a power outlet and shelf-ette for electronics next to every bunk, it was a bit soulless with too many families and large groups of traveling students for my taste. Book with caution.</p>
					<br>
					<p><b>Getting to and from the airport:</b></p> 
					<p>If you are staying somewhere in the center of Sydney (and near a train station) the <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/"target="_blank">Airport Link</a> train service is a breeze. It runs frequently, takes 30 minutes tops to get from the airport to your destination and is around $15 AUD one way. We took it to our hostel after nearly 24 hours of air travel from the states and I didn&#39;t regret it. However, on our second trip into Sydney we decided to splurge on a taxi, and we ended up sitting in rush hour traffic. Nothing makes me more crazy than sitting in a car that isn&#39;t moving (especially when I&#39;m losing precious time in a beautiful city on the other side of the world!!!), and I&#39;m pretty sure my travel mates wanted to kill me as I stared out the window, huffing and puffing. Take the train if you can. It&#39;s the least you can do after all that carbon you&#39;ve released into the atmosphere by flying there.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Also, be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle bus (route 555) to get around the city center during the day. You can find more info on public transportation (and pretty much everything) here: <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/explore/getting-around/public-transport" target="_blank">City of Sydney</a></p>
