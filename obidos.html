				<p>On our way back from Porto down to Lisbon we decided to stay a night in the Castelo de Obidos, a castle that has been converted to a hotel by <a href="http://www.pousadasofportugal.com/" target="_blank">Pousadas de Portugal</a>. Pousadas de Portugal is a state-owned enterprise that runs scenic hotels, usually in historic buildings like old castles. We picked the Castelo de Obidos because it was on our way, and because the hotel really looks like a medieval castle. The town of Obidos is totally encompassed by the castle walls, with the castle proper at the top of a large hill. The one challenge we didn&#39;t envision when we booked the hotel was driving our Peugot through a small opening in the castle walls and up a steep hill along the tiniest cobblestone streets that I&#39;ve ever seen. We managed to do it without destroying the Peugot or any historic buildings, but it was certainly nerve wracking.</p> 

				<p>Nerve wracking but worth it. I think I repeated “We&#39;re in a castle!” about eight million times while we were there, and I insisted on walking the whole way round the city walls. Our room itself looked old and castle-y too with medieval decor, but happily included a small modern bathroom. Authenticity only goes so far with me. There are only 17 sleeping rooms in the castle, and I think we lucked out on getting a room by traveling in the off season and booking well in advance.</p>

				<p>Entertainment is sort of limited within the town of Obidos, but there are cute little shops, cafes and restaurants. It&#39;s touristy, but not obnoxiously so. There wasn&#39;t anyone dressed like a medieval knight running through the streets challenging people to joust or anything like that. They do host a big medieval festival every summer though, and I can&#39;t vouch for what it&#39;s like then.</p>
				
				<p>We had just missed the annual chocolate festival when we visited, but there was still plenty of chocolate to be had. Obidos is known for its Ginja, a cherry liqueur that is served in little dark chocolate cups. It was delicious, but I can only imagine what a few too many of those Ginjas might do to you. Luckily we managed to control ourselves and made it out of Obidos in time to catch our flight the next day.</p>
