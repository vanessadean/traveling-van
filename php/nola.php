					<h4 class="heading">The Sights (and sounds)</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>Live music is everywhere in New Orleans. The sheer density of it on Frenchmen Street is impressive, with clubs lining the street and musicians set up on the sidewalk in between. The night I visited, my friends and I popped into the <a href="http://www.spottedcatmusicclub.com/" target="_blank">Spotted Cat</a> for a set by the <a href="http://www.panoramajazzband.com/" target="_blank">Panorama Jazz Band</a> and afterwards crossed the street for a Monsoon at <a href="http://www.snugjazz.com/site/" target="_blank">Snug Harbor</a>. Snug Harbor is definitely one of the classier looking joints on the block, but they still served me up in a giant plastic go cup. You can drink on the street anywhere in New Orleans as long as you are carrying your beverage in a safe plastic container. Safety first. Next time that I&#39;m in New Orleans I plan to spend a lot more time on Frenchmen Street. It&#39;s definitely more my style than the rowdiness of Bourbon Street.</p>

					<p>A walk down Bourbon Street is an assault to the ears from cover bands of every type and talent. It&#39;s easy to get dragged into a random bar by one of the aggressive bouncers lining the block, but I recommend that you proceed directly to the <a href="http://thefunkypirate.com/" target="_blank">Funky Pirate</a>: home of New Orleans largest local musician, <a href="http://www.bigalcarson.com/" target="_blank">Big Al Carson</a>. The night that my friends and I visited, we were treated to original tunes such as "Built for Comfort (Not for Speed)” and “Fix My Nuts” while sipping enormous cups of Funky Pirate beer. Sadly, we did not hear Al play “Take Your Drunken Ass Home” before we left, but <a href="http://youtu.be/IGCBX1WuTQA" target="_blank">here</a> it is for your viewing pleasure.</p>

					<p>We also did a few non-drinking activities, but had to divide and conquer to take it all in during our short visit. Some of us visited the <a href="http://www.backstreetmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Backstreet Museum</a>, others <a href="http://www.mardigrasworld.com/‎" target="_blank">Mardi Gras World</a> and one lucky visitor went on a cemetery tour. I opted for the swamp tour because I wanted to feed the alligators marshmallows. Unfortunately, that is no longer an option, but the alligators either haven&#39;t figured this out yet or they know that some of the tour guides, like ours, are still willing to throw them a few &#39;mallows on the sly. We saw several gators swimming around during the tour, and there was even a baby one on the boat that everyone took turns holding. We booked our tour on a whim so I don&#39;t know if it was the best one out there, but our guide was a genuine alligator hunter working to catch a ten foot gator that would break his standing record. There are probably enough gators in the bayou that every tour sees a few.</p>

					<p>Even though the rowdiness of Bourbon Street is not really my cup of tea there were a few things that I wanted to see for myself, including the Shark Attack! at <a href="http://tropicalisle.com/‎" target="_blank">Tropical Isle</a>. We visited a smaller TI so we didn’t get the full treatment with actual bells and whistles, but a drink containing a shark full of grenadine was plenty of excitement for me. The other hot spots that we hit up for horrific cocktails and fun times were <a href="http://www.patobriens.com/patobriens/" target="_blank">Pat O&#39;Brien&#39;s</a> for Hurricanes and <a href="http://www.lafittesblacksmithshop.com/Homepage.html" target="_blank">Lafitte&#39;s Blacksmith Shop</a> for the Voodoo Daiquiri. Lafitte&#39;s is the oldest bar in America and is entirely lit by candles at night and powered by an extension cord strung over from the building next door. Pat O&#39;s piano bar was a blast too, and if you&#39;re not a fan of the Hurricane you can always order a Sazerac.</p>
					<p>If you are looking for a more refined cocktail experience, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.arnaudsrestaurant.com/french-75/" target="_blank">Arnaud&#39;s French 75 Bar</a>. It felt like another world and an absolute sanctuary from the chaos on Bourbon Street. I would have stayed there all night sampling every cocktail on the menu if I&#39;d had more time in the city.</p>
					<p>The other great spot we visited near Bourbon Street was <a href="http://killerpoboys.com" target="_blank">Killer Poboys</a> in the back of the <a href="http://www.erinrosebar.com/" target="_blank">Erin Rose Bar</a>. In their own words: Killer Poboys serves Internationally Inspired, Chef Crafted, New Orleans Style Sandwiches. Their coriander lime gulf shrimp po boy was deadly good and pairing it with a famous Frozen Irish Coffee from Erin Rose about sent me to heaven.</p>
					<p>Another big winner in the food department was <a href="http://www.cochonrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Cochon</a>. The menu was so fantastic that it was a struggle not to order one of everything. Luckily our large and friendly group was happy to share, so we didn&#39;t have to make too many hard choices. I loved the soft shell crab that I ordered, and other standouts were the crab stuffed artichokes, the rabbit and dumplings and the banana cream pie.</p>

					<p>A few other places that deserve a shoutout are <a href="http://therooseveltneworleans.com/dining/the-sazerac-bar.html" target="_blank">The Sazerac Bar</a> for their Ramos Gin Fizz, <a href="http://www.galatoires.com/home" target="_blank">Galatoire&#39;s</a> for its fancy, old-fashioned hospitality and <a href="http://www.commanderspalace.com/" target="_blank">Commander&#39;s Palace</a> for the delicious food, $0.25 lunch-time martinis and an unbelievably tasty $5 Sidecar. Check out my google map for all of the places we visited and a few that I&#39;m saving for next time.</p>

					<p>This might sound ridiculous, but one of the luxuries in New Orleans was the possibility of fitting six or seven people into one cab. New York City cabbies pretty uniformly refuse to let more than four people ride with them, so it was fantastic to avoid the fire drills that cabbing around with a large group in New York sometimes entails. All of our cab drivers were also extremely polite and strangely quiet. It was nice, but sort of made me miss the colorful characters that you often find behind the wheel of a New York City cab.</p>

					<p>Our accomodations at the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/msyla-new-orleans-marriott/" target="_blank">Marriott New Orleans</a> were decent but unremarkable. The hotel is in a good location, they have a nice little outdoor pool and it was good for the price we paid. Recommended for the budget-conscious traveler.</p>
