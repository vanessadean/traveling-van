					<p>Uluru (Ayers Rock), is one of Australia&#39;s best known landmarks and a major tourist attraction. We visited during the off-season and it was nice to avoid some of the crowds, but I wouldn&#39;t dare to go back in full-blown summer. We lucked out with, what was described as, mild weather for that time of year, but it was still brutally hot. There were points in the hike around Uluru when I didn&#39;t think I was going to make it.</p>

					<p>The other two major stops on our tour of the Outback were Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) and Kings Canyon. I fared much better during our early morning hikes at these spots; the only time in recent memory that I&#39;ve been up before the sun. Watching the sun rise across the top of Kings Canyon before hiking down into the Garden of Eden was incredible though. We all dove into a watering hole at the bottom of the canyon and floating in the cool water, looking up at the copper canyon walls against the blue sky felt like heaven.</p> 

					<p>The other memorable thing that we did on our trip was feed the rock wallabies at the <a href="http://www.auroraresorts.com.au/Attractions/HandFeedRockWallabiesAliceSprings.aspx" target="_blank">Heavitree Gap Outback Lodge</a> in Alice Springs. The hotel sells bags of food pellets and as the sun sets you just sit at the bottom of a hill and wait for the wallabies to come to you. They literally eat right out of your hand. I even encountered a very hungry mama wallaby with a joey in her pouch that gripped my hand so tightly I could feel her little claws. I&#39;m aware that feeding wild animals may not be an ecologically sound practice, but it was really freaking fun.</p>

					<p>Our first pit stop as we drove from Alice Springs into the outback was a little town called Curtin Springs that sells &#8220;Fucking Good Port.&#8221; I can&#39;t even remember the story of who first started making the port or why they sell it there, but they are not kidding. It&#39;s delicious.</p>

					<p>We also ate a few interesting things during our visit, including Emu and Kangaroo burgers (a little tough and generally unmemorable) and some tasty damper. Damper is traditionally a simple, unleavened bread that is baked in the dampened hot coals of a campfire. Our tour guide made us a fancy version with blue cheese, and if you&#39;re feeling adventurous here are some <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/Damper" target="_blank">recipes</a> that you can try at home or on your next camping trip.</p>

				<h4 class="heading">The Nitty Gritty</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>There are several tour companies that will take you into the outback, and after a little research we decided to go with <a href="http://www.emurun.com.au/" target="_blank">Emu Run Tours</a>. They do a few different types, but we heard from Australian friends that the best way to experience the outback is camping in a swag. I realize now that this is a good example of the Aussie sense of humor, and that they may have been messing with us a bit. A swag is essentially a big canvas sack with a sleeping bag in it, which was roughing it harder than I ever have before. I'm so glad we did it though. It was too hot to be in a tent anyway, and we were all so exhausted at the end of the day that we barely had time to look up at the stars before falling asleep. I&#39;m partially glad that I did it for the bragging rights, but mostly because the three-day tour gave us time to hike around Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon. You have to see Uluru because that&#39;s the big landmark, but the other two spots were really what I enjoyed most about the trip.</p>

					<p>One last thing. There are a couple of options for getting to Uluru for a tour. We chose to fly into Alice Springs and start our tour there because it worked out with timing and our budget, but you can also fly directly into Ayers Rock instead.</p>
