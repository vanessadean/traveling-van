					<p>It&#39;s horrifying to think that by visiting the Great Barrier Reef you might be contributing to its demise. We did quite a bit of research to find an eco-certified company that did smallish tours to the outer reef and went with <a href="http://www.poseidon-cruises.com.au/" target="_blank">Poseidon Cruises</a> out of Port Douglas for a snorkeling day tour. It was stinger season during our trip and they provided full-body stinger wetsuits for everyone, which were great for keeping warm in the water and had the added bonus of making everyone look like ridiculous James Bond-type villains. Stingers are tiny jellyfish with venom that attacks your nervous system resulting in death or, best case scenario, crushing pain throughout your body that lasts for several days.</p> 

					<p>It was easy to forget about the stingers though because the reef is gorgeous and the fish are spectacular. We made stops at three different reefs on the tour, and I had to drag myself out of the water each time they called us back to the boat. If I ever make it back, I&#39;m going to do a three- or five-day scuba tour, so I can really get face to face with the fishies.</p> 

					<p>The other fun thing that we did while we were in Queensland was a tour of the <a href="http://www.athertontablelands.com.au/" target="_blank">Atherton Tablelands</a>. I was really skeptical that the three of us could just hop into a car and drive into the rainforest, but we didn&#39;t get lost once and it ended up being a great day. My favorite part of the day was swimming under the Millaa Millaa waterfalls. I think we lucked out on our timing because there was hardly anyone else around, even though it&#39;s a major stop for tours in the area. If you really want to avoid the crowds there are a couple of other waterfalls on the circuit, Zillie and Ellinjaa Falls, that aren&#39;t quite as accessible for tour buses.</p> 

					<p>Another great spot for swimming and some easy hiking is Lake Eacham, although we had limited luck spotting any exotic local wildlife. We were hoping to find platypi, but the only creatures we encountered were some turtles, lots of wild turkeys and one little snake.</p>

					<h4 class="heading">Food and Booze</h4>
					<div class="text">
					<p>Our hostel in Cairns was right next to a great bar/restaurant called the <a href="http://www.greenantcantina.com/" target="_blank">Green Ant Cantina</a>. It had delicious food, a fantastic outdoor patio space and its own line of beer, including a boozy ginger beer that I loved.</p>

					<p>Another nice place that we found for lunch was <a href="http://www.vivo.com.au/" target="_blank"> Vivo Bar and Grill</a> in Palm Cove. There isn&#39;t really a swim beach in Cairns, but there are beautiful beaches up the coast between Cairns and Port Douglas and we took a day trip up to Palm Cove. Even though swimming was limited beause of the stingers, the beach was gorgeous and the watermelon martini at Vivo hit the spot.</p>

					<p>When we were looking for affordable places to stay near the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns seemed like the best option for hostels. And even though it was obviously the most affordable town, for whatever reason, I still expected it to be a charming little beachside village. Not the case. Cairns serves mostly as a starting point for tourists in the area, rather than a destination. Except for what appeared to be quite a few down-on-their luck backpackers living on the street. If you&#39;re looking for a charming beachside village, pony up and stay in Port Douglas or Palm Cove.</p>

					<p>Cairns grew on me though because we stayed in a fantastic hostel. The <a href="http://www.travellersoasis.com.au/" target="_blank">Traveler&#39;s Oasis</a> was clean, charming and run by some of the nicest and most helpful people that we met the entire trip. They were incredibly patient with the million and one questions that we had about deadly plant and animal life in the area. I also never would have agreed to our self-guided tour of the Atherton Tablelands if they hadn&#39;t encouraged us to explore and helped us plan out our route. On top of that, they set aside pizzas for us on pizza night even though we showed up really late for dinner after our hike. The only drawback is that the hostel is a little on the outskirts of town. Although, I don&#39;t see much reason to be close to the center of town. At any rate, read the reviews before you book anywhere. The horror stories that I read about other hostels made me appreciate how lucky we were to find the place.</p>
