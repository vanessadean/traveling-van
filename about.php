				<p>I&#39;m traveling Van(essa) and this website is a place for me to swap stories with other travelers and plan for future trips. My philosophy on planning a trip is to research like crazy, plan all kinds of stuff and then when I get there, take a deep breath and relax. I think making an itinerary is about giving yourself options, not checking off boxes on a list. I like to pick out a few things that are a priority, then have a map at the ready and see where the day takes me. I get almost as much pleasure from creating a Google map for a new destination as I do traveling there.</p>

				<p>Last but not least, the impetus behind creating this site was my interest in web design. I built this site to practice what Iâ€™m learning and showcase my skills. So if you see something wonky or you have a suggestion to make it better, or even if just you see a typo, please let me know so I can fix it. This is a work in progress that I plan to expand upon as I learn more. I&#39;ll also be posting my other projects <a href="http://www.thisisvanessa.com">here</a>.</p>
