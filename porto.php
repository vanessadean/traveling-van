					<p>Porto's biggest tourist draws are the port wine cellars, but it is also one of Europe&#39;s oldest city centers. It&#39;s picturesquely located on rocky hills overlooking the Douro River and most of the port cellars are right across the river in the city of Gaia. The first thing we did when we arrived in Porto was walk across the Ponte Dom Luis and take the <a href="http://www.gaiacablecar.com/Teleferico_UK.html" target="_blank">Telef&eacute;rico de Gaia</a>, a gondola, from the top of the bridge down to the cellars. It&#39;s quick and easy and affords a beautiful view of the Douro river and Porto across the way.</p>

					<p>There are a ton of port cellars that you can visit in Gaia, but we only made it to one at <a href="http://eng.sograpevinhos.eu/visitas/cave/6" target="_blank">Ferreira Cellars</a>. Ferreira was founded by a local Douro family and was piloted to prominence by Dona Ant√≥nia Adelaide Ferreira, one of the few women in the port business at the time and since. I wish I could tell you more about her, but we chose to take the tour in Portuguese because we didn&#39;t want to wait for the English tour. I picked up about half of what our guide was saying, but the tour itself wasn&#39;t as important to us as tasting the wine at the end.</p>
					<p>On the way back to Porto from Gaia we walked along the lower section of the Ponte Dom Luis and took the <a href="http://www.metrodoporto.pt/PageGen.aspx?WMCM_PaginaId=10035" target="_blank">Funicular dos Guindais</a> back up to where our hostel was located, another fun and easy way to get from point A to B.</p>
					
					<p>On our second day in Porto we left the city for a drive out to visit the vineyards along the Douro River. We ended up being the only two people on the tour and our guides from <a href="http://www.portodouro.com/" target="_blank"> Porto Douro Tours</a> were fantastic. Props to our driver for making her way up some pretty scary, tight roads up the hills to our first stop at <a href="http://www.luuux.com/places/caves-da-murganheira" target="_blank">Murganheira Cellars</a>. We made a couple of other stops, but the highlight of the tour for me was walking around the gardens at <a href="http://www.aveledaportugal.pt/" target="_blank">Quinta Aveleda</a> vineyard. We also, of course, tasted plenty of Quinta Aveleda&#39;s speciality, vinho verde. Vinho verde is made with young grapes before they are fully ripened, which makes for a light, refreshing white wine with a lower alcohol content and slight fizz. It&#39;s delicious served very cold and is a great summer wine.</p>

					<p>The most scenic options for dinner in Porto are the restaurants lined up along the Cais de Ribeira facing the Douro River and Gaia. We visited Porto in March so it was pretty chilly, but we still chose to sit outside under the heat lamps and it was delightful. I think I was talked into some type of bacalao dish, which is a salted codfish that you really only need to try once unless you enjoy having your taste buds seared off by salt. I&#39;m ashamed to say that I can&#39;t remember the name of the restaurant we went to, but I&#39;ll give a shout out to these guys for having a fun little website: <a href="http://www.acanastradaribeira.com/" target="blank">Canastra da Ribeira</a>.<p>
					<p>We were only in Porto for two nights and on our second night we had dinner at a tapas and wine bar near our hostel called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Canelas-de-Coelho/476475225756689" target="_blank">Canelas de Coelho</a>. The decor and the food both had a modern but cosy feel and the desserts were crazy delicious. I recommend it if you&#39;re looking for a spot that the locals might frequent.</p> 
					<p>And last but not least, we could not leave Porto without eating a Francesinha sandwich. This abomination is a bit like a croque monsieur gone wild, or a croque madame if you chose to add a fried egg on top. We ordered the classic Francesinha with a filling of ham, roast beef and two different types of sausage, a slice of melted cheese and a fried egg on top, served on a bed of french fries with gravy poured all over everything. According to our waiter, this sandwich is always, ALWAYS, accompanied by a glass of beer and never water. Even when you order one at 10am, which is something that we may not have done had we known what we were getting into. This is a must though. Do not leave Porto until you eat this sandwich.</p>

					<p>We rented a car to get from Lisbon to Porto and back again and the rental process and drive up were both super easy. Of course it helped that my travel mate spoke Spanish fluently, which was close enough to Portuguese for us to easily communicate with the guys at the airport car rental. No one in Lisbon was offended when she used Spanish to communicate, but the lady running our hostel in Porto did not seem to like it. <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Porto" target="_blank">Wikitravel</a> sums up the reason behind that better than I can: "If you speak in Spanish to a local, you will be largely understood and as a rule they will freely converse with you, but from time to time, more so with the older generation, you may be politely reminded that you are in Portugal and the native language is Portuguese."</p>
					<p>Our patroness was polite enough about it, even though she ignored my friend and insisted on solely addressing me in Portuguese, but we were able to get by. The hostel itself was pretty charmless, but it was clean, the location was good and our room had a nice big bathroom. You could do worse than <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pt/residencial-triunfo.en.html" target="_blank">Residencial Triunfo</a> in Porto.</p>
