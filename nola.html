					<p>Live music is everywhere in New Orleans. A walk down Bourbon Street is an assault to the ears from cover bands of every type and talent. You could allow yourself to get dragged into a random bar by one of the aggressive bouncers lining the block, but I recommend that you proceed directly to the <a href="http://thefunkypirate.com/" target="_blank">Funky Pirate</a>: home of New Orleans largest local musician, <a href="http://www.bigalcarson.com/" target="_blank">Big Al Carson</a>. The night that my friends and I visited, we were treated to original tunes such as "Built for Comfort (Not for Speed)” and “Fix My Nuts” while sipping Funky Pirate beer from the most enormous cups that I&#39;ve ever seen. Sadly, we did not hear Al play “Take Your Drunken Ass Home” before we left, but <a href="http://youtu.be/IGCBX1WuTQA" target="_blank">here</a> it is for your viewing pleasure. Needless to say, it is even better in person.</p>
					<p>If you&#39;re looking for more serious music, then you can&#39;t beat Frenchmen Street for sheer density. The street is lined with clubs and musicians set up on the sidewalk in between. We popped into the <a href="http://www.spottedcatmusicclub.com/" target="_blank">Spotted Cat</a> for a set by the <a href="http://www.panoramajazzband.com/" target="_blank">Panorama Jazz Band</a> and afterwards crossed Frenchmen for a Monsoon at <a href="http://www.snugjazz.com/site/" target="_blank">Snug Harbor</a>. Snug Harbor is definitely one of the classier looking joints on the block, but they still served me up in a giant plastic go cup. You can drink on the street anywhere in New Orleans as long as you are carrying your beverage in a safe plastic container. Safety first. Next time that I&#39;m in New Orleans I plan to spend a lot more time on Frenchmen Street. It&#39;s definitely more my style than the rowdiness of Bourbon Street.</p>
					<p>My travel mates and I also did a few non-drinking activities, but we had to divide and conquer to take it all in during our short visit. Some visited the <a href="http://www.backstreetmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Backstreet Museum</a>, others <a href="http://www.mardigrasworld.com/‎" target="_blank">Mardi Gras World</a> and one lucky visitor who was in the city for a few extra days went on a cemetery tour. I opted for the swamp tour because I wanted to feed the alligators. Unfortunately, that is no longer an option because someone decided that if marshmallows aren&#39;t healthy for humans, we probably shouldn&#39;t be feeding them to alligators either. Fortunately the alligators either haven&#39;t figured this out or they know that some of the tour guides, like ours, are still willing to throw them a few &#39;mallows on the sly.</p>
					<p>We booked our tour on a whim so I don&#39;t know if it was the best one out there, but our guide was a genuine alligator hunter working on break his record for a ten foot gator. We saw several gators swimming around during the tour, and there was even a baby gator right on the boat that everyone took turns holding. I think there are probably enough of them out there that you would see a few no matter which tour you take. </p>

					<p>Even though the rowdiness of Bourbon Street is not really my cup of tea there were a few things that I wanted to see for myself, including the Shark Attack! at <a href="http://tropicalisle.com/‎" target="_blank">Tropical Isle</a>. We popped into a smaller TI so we didn’t get the full treatment with actual bells and whistles, but a drink containing a shark full of grenadine was plenty of excitement for me. The other hot spots that we hit up for horrific cocktails and fun times were <a href="http://www.patobriens.com/patobriens/" target="_blank">Pat O&#39;Brien&#39;s</a> for Hurricanes and <a href="http://www.lafittesblacksmithshop.com/Homepage.html" target="_blank">Lafitte&#39;s Blacksmith Shop</a> for the Voodoo Daiquiri. Lafitte&#39;s is the oldest bar in America and is entirely lit by candles at night and powered by an extension cord strung over from the building next door. Pat O&#39;s piano bar was a blast too, and if you&#39;re not a fan of the Hurricane you can always order a Sazerac.</p>
					<p>If you are looking for a more refined cocktail experience, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.arnaudsrestaurant.com/french-75/" target="_blank">Arnaud&#39;s French 75 Bar</a>. It felt like another world and an absolute sanctuary from the chaos on Bourbon Street. I would have stayed there all night sampling every cocktail on the menu if I&#39;d had more time in the city.</p>
					<p>The other great spot we visited near Bourbon Street was <a href="http://killerpoboys.com" target="_blank">Killer Poboys</a> in the back of the <a href="http://www.erinrosebar.com/" target="_blank">Erin Rose Bar</a>. In their own words: Killer Poboys serves Internationally Inspired, Chef Crafted, New Orleans Style Sandwiches. Their coriander lime gulf shrimp po boy was deadly good and pairing it with a famous Frozen Irish Coffee from Erin Rose about sent me to heaven.</p>
					<p>The other absolutely delicious thing that I ate in New Orleans was a soft shell crab at <a href="http://www.cochonrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Cochon</a>. The menu at Cochon was so fantastic that it was a struggle not to order one of everything. Luckily our large and friendly group was able to order and share a bunch of different things without having to make too many hard choices. Some standouts were the crab stuffed artichokes, the rabbit and dumplings and the banana cream pie, which really unexpectedly stole my heart.</p>
					<p>I&#39;ve included a google map with all of the places we visited, and a few that I’m saving for next time, but some shoutouts go to <a href="http://therooseveltneworleans.com/dining/the-sazerac-bar.html" target="_blank">The Sazerac Bar</a> and their Ramos Gin Fizz, <a href="http://www.galatoires.com/home" target="_blank">Galatoire&#39;s</a> for its real fancy, old-fashioned hospitality and <a href="http://www.commanderspalace.com/" target="_blank">Commander&#39;s Palace</a> for the delicious food, $0.25 lunch-time martinis and an unbelievably tasty $5 Sidecar.</p>

					<p>This might sound ridiculous, but to me one of the biggest luxuries in New Orleans was the possibility of fitting six or seven people into one cab. New York City cabbies pretty uniformly refuse to let more than four people ride with them, even if they have the extra seats, so it was fantastic to be able to avoid the fire drills that cabbing around with a large group in New York sometimes entails. It seemed like every cab driver we had in New Orleans also knew where they were going, not that we were going anywhere obscure, and were all polite and strangely quiet. It was nice, but sort of made me miss the colorful characters that you often find behind the wheel of a New York City cab.</p>
					<p>We didn't need to rely much on cabs though because the location of our hotel was great. Other than the prime location and a nice little outdoor pool, the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/msyla-new-orleans-marriott/" target="_blank">Marriott New Orleans</a> was decent but unremarkable. It was good for the price we paid, and I would recommend it for the budget-conscious traveler.</p>
