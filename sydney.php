					<div class="text">
					<p>There are so many great things about Sydney, but for me the kicker is how easy it is to get from the city center to fantastic public beaches. My friends and I visited Bondi and Manly beaches while we were in town, and although the weather didn&#39;t cooperate with us for sunbathing at Bondi, the beach itself is gorgeous. It was also great weather for a little hike along the coastline up to Bronte.</p> 
					
					<p>The weather was more beachworthy for our trip to Manly, which is about a 30 minute ferry ride across the harbor, and I managed to get a quick dip into the ocean before the jellyfish warnings went into full effect. You&#39;re never far from something that can maim or kill you in Australia. The town of Manly itself also has cute shops and restaurants, and we spent a full afternoon walking around. We ended up at a little restaurant called <a href="http://www.chicabonita.com.au/" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a> for lunch and had really tasty burritos and margaritas. It never ceases to amaze me how far away the love of Mexican food travels from its roots.<p>  

					<p>The absolute highlight of our trip to Sydney though was the <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/" target="_blank">Sydney Harbor Bridge Climb</a>. If you do it, splurge for the twilight tour over the top, or the dawn tour if you&#39;re a maniac. The view of the harbor from the top of the bridge is amazing, especially as the sun sets and the lights of the city turn on. Fair warning, if you are afraid of heights think very hard before taking the tour. You are strapped onto the bridge the whole time and it&#39;s perfectly safe, but there is no turning back once you get out there. There is also at least one point of the tour where you can see straight down to the water below.</p>

					<p>Our dining and drinking highlights in Sydney included <a href="http://www.chatthai.com.au/" target="_blank">Chat Thai</a>, <a href="http://thewinerysurryhills.com.au/" target="_blank">The Winery</a>, <a href="http://yullis.com.au/" target="_blank">Yulli&#39;s</a> (vegan) and <a href="http://www.chicabonita.com.au/" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a> at Manly Beach.</p>
					<p>One other note: Dining out is crazy expensive in Australia, so be prepared for that. The cheap eats list on <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com" target="_blank">Urbanspoon</a> was really helpful on that front.</p>

					<p>Accommodations</p>
					<p>We flew to and from the states through Sydney, with visits to other parts of Australia in between, so our time there was split between two different hostels, the Y Hotel Hyde Park and Sydney Harbour YHA.</p>

					<p>Although the <a href="http://www.yhotel.com.au/content/hydepark.htm" target="_blank">Y Hotel Hyde Park</a> was not glamorous, it was clean, quiet and in a perfect location close to Hyde Park, a subway station and the bus to Bondi Beach. They also upgraded us to a private ensuite. Similar results not guaranteed, but I still highly recommend it.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/sydney-harbour/" target="_blank">Sydney Harbour YHA</a> was interesting. It&#39;s a brand new building in a fun, albeit touristy, neighborhood (The Rocks) and high on a hill overlooking Sydney Harbor and the Opera House. The view from the rooftop deck sold me on the place, and we did have a lovely little dinner of wine and cheese up there one night. BUT they couldn&#39;t book the three of us in the same room (even though all three spots were booked at the same time and under the same credit card), and my travelmates had horrific problems with the A/C in their room. It was nice to be in a brand new building with amenities like power outlets next to every bunk, and the possibility of working A/C, but my final verdict is to book with caution.</p>

					<p>Getting to and from the airport:</p> 
					<p>If you are staying somewhere in the center of Sydney (and near a train station) the <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/"target="_blank">Airport Link</a> train service is a breeze. It runs frequently, takes 30 minutes tops to get from the airport to your destination and is around $15 AUD one way. We took it to our hostel after nearly 24 hours of air travel from the states and I didn&#39;t regret it.</p>

					<p>Also, be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle bus (route 555) to get around the city center during the day. You can find more info on public transportation (and pretty much everything) here: <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/explore/getting-around/public-transport" target="_blank">City of Sydney</a></p>
