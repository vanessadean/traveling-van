					<div class="text_one">
					<p>Next to the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru (Ayers Rock), is one of Australia&#39;s best known landmarks. Everyone has seen pictures of the big red rock, but that doesn&#39;t come close to capturing what it feels like to stand next to it. And it definitely does not capture what the stifling heat of an afternoon in the late spring feels like. We lucked out with, what was described as, mild weather for that time of year and even witnessed the first rain in several months, but it was still brutally hot. The advantage of visiting in the off-season is that there are far less tourists, but I wouldn&#39;t dare to go back in full-blown summer. I&#39;m smiling in most of the pictures from that first day in the outback, but there were points in the hike when I didn&#39;t think I was going to make it.</p>
				<br>
					<p>The other two major stops on our tour were Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) and Kings Canyon. I fared much better during our early morning hikes at these spots; the only times in recent memory that I&#39;ve been up before the sun. It was absolutely worth it to watch the sun rise across the top of Kings Canyon though, and our hike down into the Garden of Eden at the bottom of the canyon was incredible. We all dove into a watering hole there and the experience of floating in the cool water and looking up at the copper canyon walls against the blue sky is something that I hope to hold onto forever.</p> 
				<br>
					<p>The other memorable and fantastic thing we did was feed the rock wallabies at the <a href="http://www.auroraresorts.com.au/Attractions/HandFeedRockWallabiesAliceSprings.aspx" target="_blank">Heavitree Gap Outback Lodge in Alice Springs</a>. The hotel sells bags of food pellets and as the sun sets you just sit at the bottom of a hill and wait for the wallabies to come to you. They literally eat right out of your hand. I even encountered a very hungry mama wallaby with a joey in her pouch that gripped my hand so tightly I could feel her little claws. I&#39;m aware that feeding wild animals may not be an ecologically sound practice, but it was so freaking fun that I would do it again in a heartbeat.</p>
					<br>

				<h4 class="two">Food and Booze</h4>
					<div class="text_two">
					<p>Our first pit stop as we drove from Alice Springs into the outback, was a little town called Curtin Springs that sells &#8220;Fucking Good Port.&#8221; To be honest I can&#39;t even remember the story of who first started making the port or why they sell it there, but they are not kidding. It&#39;s delicious.</p>
				<br>
					<p>The other interesting things we consumed during our visit were Emu and Kangaroo burgers (a little tough and generally unmemorable) and some tasty damper. Damper is traditionally a simple Australian unleavened bread that is baked in the dampened hot coals of a campfire. Our tour guide made us a fancy version with blue cheese, and if you&#39;re feeling adventurous here are some <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/Damper" target="_blank">recipes</a> that you can try at home or on your next camping trip.</p>
					<br>
					</div>
				<h4 class="three">The Nitty Gritty</h4>
					<div class="text_three">
					<p>There are several tour companies that will take you into the outback and after a little research we decided to go with <a href="http://www.emurun.com.au/" target="_blank">Emu Run Tours</a>. They do a few different types of tours to sights in the area, but our local correspondent heard from Australian friends that the best way to experience the outback is camping in a swag. I realize now, after getting to know a few Aussies, that this is a good example of their sense of humor and they may have been messig with us a bit. A swag is essentially a big canvas sack with a sleeping bag in it. Which was roughing it harder than I ever have before, but absolutely worth it. It was too hot to be in a tent anyway, and we were all so exhausted at the end of the day that we barely had time to look up at the stars before falling asleep. I&#39;m glad I did it for the bragging rights, but I&#39;m also really glad we opted for the three-day tour because it gave us the time to hike around Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon. You have to see Uluru because that&#39;s the big landmark, but the other two spots were really what I enjoyed most about the trip. The experience was just rugged enough for me, and the three-day camping tour with Emu Run definitely gets my recommendation.</p>
				<br>
					<p>One last thing. There are a couple of options for getting to Uluru for a tour. We chose to fly into Alice Springs and start our tour there because it worked out with timing and our budget, but you can also fly directly into Ayers Rock instead. Of course, then you would be missing out on the rock wallabies.</p>
