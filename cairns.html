					<p>It&#39;s horrifying to think that by visiting the Great Barrier Reef you are contributing to its demise, so we did some research to find an eco-certified company that did smallish snorkeling day tours to the outer reef. We went with <a href="http://www.poseidon-cruises.com.au/" target="_blank">Poseidon Cruises</a> out of Port Douglas and they were wonderful. It was stinger season during our trip and they provided full-body stinger wetsuits for everyone, which were great for keeping warm in the water and had the added bonus of making everyone look like ridiculous James Bond-type villains. (Stingers are tiny jellyfish with venom that attacks your nervous system resulting in death or, best case scenario, crushing pain throughout your body that lasts for several days.)</p> 
					<p>It was easy to forget about the stingers though because the reef is gorgeous and the fish are spectacular. There are so many different types in all kinds of crazy fluorescent colors. We made stops at three different reefs on the tour, and I had to drag myself out of the water each time they called us back to the boat. I've promised myself that if I make it back, I’m going to do a three- or five-day tour out on a boat to get certified for scuba diving so I can really dive down with the fishies.</p> 
					<p>The other fantastic thing that we did while we were in Queensland was a tour of the <a href="http://www.athertontablelands.com.au/" target="_blank">Atherton Tablelands</a>. I was really skeptical that the three of us could just hop into a car and drive into the rainforest, but we didn&#39;t get lost once and it ended up being a great day. The Millaa Millaa waterfall was my favorite part because, for me anyway, swimming under a waterfall never gets old. It looked like little more than a trickle from the shore, but it certainly didn&#39;t feel that way when we were swimming underneath it. I think we lucked out on our timing as well because there was hardly anyone else around, even though this is a major stop for tours in the area. If you want to avoid large crowds there are a couple of other spots that are part of the waterfall circuit, Zillie and Ellinjaa Falls, that aren&#39;t quite as accessible for tour buses.</p> 
					<p>Another great spot for swimming and some easy hiking is Lake Eacham, although we had limited luck spotting any exotic local wildlife. We were hoping to find platypi, but the only creatures we encountered were some turtles, lots of wild turkeys and one little snake.</p>

					<div class="text">
					<p>We ended up at a great hostel in Cairns, and one of the greatest things about it was its location right next to the <a href="http://www.greenantcantina.com/" target="_blank">Green Ant Cantina</a>. The Cantina has a fantastic covered outdoor patio space, tons of delicious food and its own line of beer, including a boozy ginger beer that is one of the best things that I have ever tasted.</p>
					<p>Another nice spot that we found for lunch was <a href="http://www.vivo.com.au/" target="_blank"> Vivo Bar and Grill</a> in Palm Cove. There isn’t really a swim beach in Cairns, but there are beautiful beaches up the coast between Cairns and Port Douglas and we decided to take a day trip up to Palm Cove. Even though swimming is limited during stinger season, the beach is gorgeous and there are nice restaurants and shops along the esplanade.</p>

					<p>When we were looking for affordable places to stay near the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns seemed like the best option for hostels. But even though it was obviously the most affordable town, for whatever reason, I still expected it to be a charming little beachside village. Not the case. Cairns serves mostly as a starting point for tourists in the area, rather than a destination, except for what appeared to be quite a few down-on-their luck backpackers living on the street. Unfortunately, the local population seems to lump all backpackers into this category because they were not particularly welcoming at the airport as we were searching for our ride to the hostel. Having said that, within 24 hours of settling down in Cairns I felt totally comfortable. I just wish that I had known what to expect ahead of time. So there is your warning. If you&#39;re looking for a charming beachside village, pony up and stay in Port Douglas or Palm Cove.</p>
					<p>I think the biggest, if not only, reason that Cairns grew on me was the fantastic hostel we stayed in. The <a href="http://www.travellersoasis.com.au/" target="_blank">Traveler&#39;s Oasis</a> was clean, charming and run by some of the nicest and most helpful people that we met the entire trip. They were incredibly patient and helpful with the million and one questions that we had about deadly plant and animal life in the area, and I never would have agreed to our self-guided tour of the Atherton Tablelands if they hadn&#39;t encouraged us to explore and helped us plan out our route. On top of it all, they set aside pizzas for us on pizza night even though we showed up really late for dinner. A total godsend after a long day of hiking. The only drawback is that it&#39;s a little on the outskirts of town. Although I didn&#39;t see much reason to be close to the center of town. At any rate, read the reviews before you book anywhere! The horror stories that I read about other hostels made me appreciate how lucky we were to find the place.</p>
